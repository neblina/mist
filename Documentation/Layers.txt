Project is based on multiple small and simple layers. Each layer is responsible for one simple task. Every other layer
uses the previous ones. This is for simplicity and reduction of errors that may appear as the software is written.

The structure of layers is bidirectional. It means that layers goes up, to more abstract approach, as well as down, to more and more technical 
one. Layer zero is the actual program, i.e. the graph of cells exchanging messages. 

Negative numberd layers are for managing program, for example to mange and monitor which part of the program is running and 
which is not used at all. For example layer -1 may be responsible for monitoring the activity of individual cells, gathering 
information such as the number of messages per second going in and out in the cell. The layer -2 may be responsible for 
managing groups of cells and being able to stop them or migrate to other machine (the whole group).

Positive numbered layers are for building the complexity of the program itself. So for instance, layer 1, may be uesd to construct 
simple tasks needed for computation. Layer 2  can represent the virtual machine that is designed using layer 1. Layers 3, someting 
equivalent to operating system. Layer 4, the API for more complex applications, and so on.
