A cell has one output and two inputs. A cell knows from which input a message came. A cell has only two states. Every message 
on any input produces an output and triggers change of state. Each input is a one bit data. Each output is one bit data
as well.

Cells are connected to each other and the connection is determined on the compilation time, cannot be change
in run time.
