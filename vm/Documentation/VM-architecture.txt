There are the components:

1. Load Bucket of cells (used for loading from files or other sources).
2. Runtime Bucket of cells ( cells that are executed by vm).
3. Queue of messages (one queue for all cells).


Threads:

1. Thread that runns all cells
2. Thread that is responsible for communcations with outside world ( i.e. loading cells to Load Bucket)
3. Thread used to network connections (maybe multible ones, one per connection, we will see)
