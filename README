Mist Project.

This is a project which goal is to create a simple virtual machine
that could run graph base programs. Each program is a simple graph 
of cells, where each cell is a simple "CPU" that can compute and manipulate 
very simple peace of information. A whole program is a set of cells ( simple CPUs )
that compute and exchange simple messages with each other. There is no distinction
between RAM and CPU. There is only a cell, which is a RAM and CPU in once. 

Each cell is in a container that runs the code of the cell. A container is simply
a virutal machine that iterpretes the code. There can be meny containers in one 
phisical machine. Containers can be executed in different phisical machines, and 
conected witch each other. A cell can then move freely between containers, and it 
is a job of containers to keep all in consistent state.
