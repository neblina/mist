Mist Project.

This is a project which goal is to create a simple virtual machine
that could run graph base programs. Each program is a simple graph 
of cells, where each cell is a simple "CPU" that can compute and manipulate 
very simple peace of information. A whole program is a set of cells ( simple CPUs )
that compute and exchange simple messages with each other. Ther is no distinction
between RAM and CPU. There is only a cell, which is a RAM and CPU in once.
